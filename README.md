# RCRemote
Wireless IOS software to control the robot motion by Wifi

Welcome to RCRemote, here's the several steps for your setup:

### Hardware Requirements
This project has two parts: Client (iPhone) & Server (Computer to run the Unity environment)
* Client: Generally, you can run the software on any iOS devices like iPhone or iPad or some other Apple products with accelerator and CoreMotion sensors. Update iPhone to iOS 13 or higher. Since the app is not on the Apple Store, you may need an extra MacBook to download the software and transfer it to your iPhone/iPad.
* Server: Since the server is build on RCareWorld Unity executable file right now, so the requirement is the same as the requirements we have for PhyRC Challenge, which you can find here: https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld/tree/phy-robo-care. Ubuntu system is highly recommanded.

---
### Setup
##### 1. Server Setup
First go to the RCareWorld repository https://github.com/empriselab/RCareWorld/tree/phy-robo-care, follow the whole README instructions to get the environmnet we need. That may take 20 mins.

After your environment all set (You've already build all RCareWorld staff and run the test), make sure switch the branch to phy-robo-care, then get the Server code: 
```
git clone https://github.com/empriselab/RCRemote.git
git checkout Server
```
In the Server branch, you will see a python file named: *example_kinova_gen3_move.py* which is the example file to show how to import WebSocket and robot command to Unity, **you can copy this file directly to *RCareWorld/pyrcareworld/pyrcareworld/demo/examples/*** or learn the stategies in the file to control robots in any other unity executable file.

##### 2. Client Setup
About the client, first you have to find **a macbook** which can install Xcode 11.0 or higher, Xcode is used to build iOS software which uses Swift language, After you install the Xcode 11.0 or higher, command:
```
git clone https://github.com/empriselab/RCRemote.git
git checkout Software
```
After that, open the repository in Xcode, the structures looks like that:

Click the top blue RCRemote, in the setting page, choose a Personal team, you can use same Apple ID as your iPhone to login:

There's no need for you to modify the code, the only thing you may want to change is the refresh rate of sending command to Server, which you can find in ContentView, Line 38:
```
motionManager.deviceMotionUpdateInterval = 1.0 / 60.0
```
The default speed is 60 fps which is good for most of tasks, but you may change it higher like 120Hz (1.0 / 120.0).

After that, open the developer mode on your iPhone/iPad. Then connect your iPhone/ipad to macbook with USB cables, trust the devices, on the top middle in Xcode window you will see:

Switch the Build device to iPad or iPhone, then click the Run button left:

First time may not build sccessful since even your mac trust the mobile device, the software still not be trusted, so you need go to *Settings - Privacy & Security* to allow the installment. Then run the software again, you will see the software icon is already on your iPhone/iPad, witch means you've install the software on your device:

**Congratulations! The setup part is all set~**

### Connection
To connect iPhone/iPad to Unity scene to control robot, open Server/Client which one first is not important, you do following steps:

##### 0. Make sure both iPhone and Server is under the same Wifi.

##### 1. Server Connection
For Server, we first need to find the address and port.

**For Windows system**, use command:
```
ipconfig
```
The address is line of number followed 'IPv4', for example: 
```
IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.58.104
```
Then the address is 192.168.58.104 in this example.

**For Ubuntu system**, use command:
```
ifconfig
```
The address is line of number followed 'inet', for example:
```
wlp4s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.58.104  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.58.255
```
Then the address is 192.168.58.104 in this example.


After you find the address, open example_kinova_gen3_move.py, in Line 141:
```
loop.run_until_complete(websockets.serve(handle_client, "192.168.58.104", 1145))
```
Replace the 192.168.58.104 to your own address, number 1145 is the default port, you can also modify the port to control multiple robot in different Unity scene.

Then save the file, command:
```
conda activate rcareworld
cd RCareWorld/pyrcareworld/pyrcareworld/demo/examples/
python example_kinova_gen3_move.py
```

Server is setup.

##### 2. Client Setup
Open RCRemote in your iPhone/iPad, it should looks like that:

![IMG_A49E18BE5BFE-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28300a09-4ba0-499b-b94c-a62414d7a72c)

Fill the address and port (default port is 1145), then click ðŸ”„ button, the connection is all set and you can see the delay ðŸ“¶, usually the delay is about 5ms, which depends on your Wifi speed.

### Functions

After connections, start using it!

![Demo Animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13445ba5-b7c0-47bc-9a1b-b93780ff8d04)

1. Fill the address & port (default port is 1145)
2. **Refresh address:** connect to server, use this each time you change address/port/Wifi
3. **Delay:** The network delay
4. **Start Sensor:** Start to collect motions and data, robot start moving
5. **Precise:** Use higher precise data, but meaningless since iPhone's sensor is not that precise
6. **Reset:** Reset the sensor status, robot stop moving
7. **Gripper Open/Close:** Control gripper open/close, we use simple api in the example example_kinova_gen3_move.py, gripper will open when the bar is over 499, but you can use better api to make gripper catch more precise.
8. **Height:** Control the height of gripper, since we only use 3DoF right now.
9. **Axis Lock:** Lock one or more axis to make robot only move in exact way.
